# üé® NewHue

**Dynamic Video-Driven DMX Lighting Control**

NewHue is an application designed to synchronize theatrical DMX lighting with live video sources. By connecting directly to a USB DMX converter, NewHue enables real-time lighting control that adapts dynamically to video input, creating immersive visual experiences for performances, concerts, houses of worship, and live events.  

Think of it as **Philips Hue meets theatrical lighting** ‚Äî smooth, responsive, and performance-ready.
